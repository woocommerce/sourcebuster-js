[Upgrade guide](UPGRADING.md) &middot; [Updated documentation](README.md)

Changes:

_Major_

  - API. Rewritten from the ground. See [upgrade guide](UPGRADING.md) and [updated documentation](README.md).
  - Changed cookie's domain handling — also see [upgrade guide](UPGRADING.md) and [updated documentation](README.md).
  - Changed default `utm_source` & `utm_medium` values for `typein` traffic — you know [what to do](UPGRADING.md) :)

_Minor_

  - Changed default timezone from UTC to user's system (default — means no custom value provided during `sbjs` initialization).

_Under the hood_

  - In short: `mess` became `structure`. Check the sources if interested.
  - Added migration tool, which updates visitor's cookies to `1.x.x`.
  - Changed params delimiter in cookies: from `|` to `|||`. Cookies will be automatically upgraded by migration tool without data loss. You don't have to worry about this change unless you parse these cookies by yourself.

Features:

  - Added `callback` option to set custom function, which will be executed right after `sbjs` cookies will be set. This function will get `sbjs.get`-object as argument (it contains all detected `sbjs` data).
  - Added ability to set custom cookies expiration period
  - Added `term` detection from Yandex Direct traffic (if there is no `utm_term` in URL)
  - Added `visits` counter: available through `sbjs.get.udata.vst`
  - Added `pages` counter for current session: available through `sbjs.get.session.pgs`
  - Added `current page` url for current session: available through `sbjs.get.session.cpg`
  - And Sourcebuster `1.0.0` available as `CommonJS` / `AMD` module.

## 0.0.7

Features:

  - add `sbjs_current_add` cookie, which holds same data as `sbjs_first_add` cookie, but for the visit when current source was written
  - add info about first referer (see changes below)

Changes:

  - move current `referer` data from stand-alone `sbjs_referer` cookie to `sbjs_current_add` cookie (and also to `sbjs_first_add` cookie, now you can get first and current referers via `get_sbjs.first_add.rf` & `get_sbjs.current_add.rf` getters)

## 0.0.6

Features:

  - add `_setPromocode` user setting to set promocode for visitor;

## 0.0.5

Features:

  - add `_setTypeinAttributes` user setting to set custom `source` and `medium` for `typein` traffic
  - set value of `content` = `referer_path` in cookies for `referral` traffic

## 0.0.4

Features:

  - add predefined organic sources into the core (see comments and the list of added sources [in the docs](./README.md#_addorganicsource))
  - add Sourcebuster to `bower` ([bower.io](http://bower.io)). Now you can [install it via... `bower`](./README.md#install)

Changes:

  - switch from Closure Compiler to UglifyJS minification library
  - switch from deprecated `escape()`/`unescape()` methods to custom `encode_data()`/`decode_data()` functions (which uses `encodeURIComponent()`/`decodeURIComponent()` with some additions) to set/get cookies. **Please pay attention to this if you parse `sbjs` cookies by yourself.**

## 0.0.3

Features:

  - add `_setTimeZoneOffset` user setting to set default time zone
  - add alias param to custom organic source (added via `_addOrganicSource`)

Changes:

  - change simple and advanced setup methods
  - change datetime format to `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss` (`2014-06-11 17:28:26`)
  - store datetime in UTC by default
  - remove events `'sbjs:set'` and `'sbjs:ready'` (see *Using the data* section for details)

Fixes:

  - fix matching of Yandex organic source
  - fix matching of custom organic source (added via `_addOrganicSource`)
  - fix getter (`get_sbjs`) in IE8 and lower
  - fix output of non-ASCII chars via `get_sbjs`

## 0.0.2

Features:

  - add Google AdWords `gclid` param handler
  - add `_setCampaignParam` user setting to set custom GET-param, whose value will be set as `utm_campaign` in cookies (if there is no original `utm_campaign` in request)
